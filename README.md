[Snapdrop](https://snapdrop.net/) but framed as a standalone PWA.

Snapdrop is a great little web app that allows cross-platform file transfers in the style of Apple's AirDrop. Sadly (for me) its PWA definition does not make it a standalone app for backwards compatibility reasons. This is a minimal wrapper (framer) that repackages snapdrop.net as a standalone PWA that continues to run while Safari is disabled on iOS.
